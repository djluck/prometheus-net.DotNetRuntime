# Summary for V4
Main goals of next release:
- As this library is now in greater use, improve the currently poor baseline performance
- Fix longstanding issues (e.g. ThreadPoolStatsCollector doesn't work)
- Make use of all events currently being collected by current level of verbosity
- Keep compatability with .NET core v3
- Remove support for v2 of prometheus-net
- Fix long-running perf bug

### v4.0.0 release
- Figure out release process
- Fix build pipeline (no need for v2/ v3 anymore)
- Perf comparison when running default and all between v2 + v3
- Long running perf test vs v3
- Review PR
- Update README (note on performance, choosing levels, metrics exposed?, example docker-compose stack, recycling, compatibility with prior configuration)
- Perform metric diff vs v3
	- Use all vs default (to note what metrics are not present by default)
	- Will be useful to note what metrics are missing now
- Write release notes (dropped support for prom v2)
- Publish prerelease version

### v4.1+ release
- DNS events
- HTTP events
- So many events in .net 5!
- Counter-based metrics for contention + JIT
- Review all existing events and look for improvements/ updates made in .NET 5
- Rethink sampling implmentation (consumption is actually single-threaded, what about circular buffer idea and time is either actual time or estimated max time)
- Review if V3 JIT/ Contention was as wrong as V4. If not, fix later. Otherwise Fix JIT + Contention CPU bug (measurements for time are way off, even with sampling off)

## Splitting up work
Need to focus on getting event counters in and reducing overhead by default.
1. Reduce overhead + sane defaults
2. Improve documentation (generate documentation automatically?)
3. Improve data collected
4. Dynamic switching
5. Advanced collection? e.g. GCSampledObjectAllocation perhaps?

## IObservable
- Separate out event producers and metric producers
- EventProducers vs EventConsumers
- EventListeners
- MetricProducers
- IEventProducers
- Metric producerss
- Different observables for different

## Example GC metric producer
- Focusing on allocation rate
- will consume IObservable<RuntimeMetrics>, GcEvents.Verbose
- Example impl. for GcEvents.Info:
```
public class Info{
	public IObservable<AllocTick> AlocTick { get; set; }
}
```

- Subscribe to both observables
- Enabled/ Disabled is good- allows us to set up metrics correctly



## Improving performance
Main cost involves the .NET runtime producing events, not processing them so we need to be smarter about when we enable the more verbose event sources. Ideas include:
- Using event counters
- Dynamic switching of metric sources

### Using event counters
Event counters should place a much lower stress on the runtime- using these could definitely help.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/event-counters#sample-code.

Counter implementation concerns:
- Rate is fixed ahead of time (min frequency = 1 sec)
- Counter values are collected separately from other events (need to provide mechanism for other profilers to consume counter values)
- Perhaps event listeners consume counters?

### Dynamic switching of metric sources
Overall could be three levels of detail for most sources, ordered in terms of perf impact (low -> high):
1. Counters
2. Events (Warning) 
2. Events (info)
3. Events (verbose)

Levels are hierarchial- enabling a more detailed level implies the others are enabled.

#### Ordering
Could start at a more verbose level and have rules to selectively enable less verbose levels. Or start at the least verbose and move towards more verbose.

#### Changing verbosity
Reasons to change include:
- A period of time has elapsed
- A counter value has changed
- Number of events being processed has changed

Depending on the information a user wishes to obtain, switching between these three verbosity levels could be useful. Scenarios include:
- Disabling more detailed collectors by default
- Enabling/ disabling collectors as conditions change (e.g. a lot of exceptions are thrown then disable high-impact collection, enabling detailed thread stats when thread pool queue times increase)

```
DotNetRuntimeStatsBuilder.LowestImpact.StartCollecting();
DotNetRuntimeStatsBuilder.AllCollectors.StartCollecting();

// This should be good enough to start, right?
Gc.DefaultLevel(Info)
	// Should we allow multiple conditions? This could help solve the problem of different evaluation timeframes
	.Use.Verbose.While(x => x.allocRate > x, evalPeriod: 5 second)
	.Use.Verbose.While(x => x.startTime < DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(2))
	.Use.Info.While(x => x.EventsSec > 100)
	.Use.Counters.While(x => true)

#### Goals of builder
- Good documentation of what metrics can be collected at each level 
- Well-typed- should not be allowed to enable a level that offers no benefit
- Easy to use!
	
// Why are we doing this?
// To control performance impact of collectors
// To enable more detail when needed
// TraceInfo, TraceVerbose
// Scenarios: 
// JIT: on startup, when a lot of JIT is happening (e.g. num methods > x)
// Contention: when number of locks contended > 5, when number of locks isn't greater than 5
// GC: when LOH > blah size (enable LOH allocs)
// ThreadPool: When queue length > x, num threads > Environment.ProcessorCount
// Exceptions: When num exceptions> blah

// Profiles:
// Perf concious- I don't want performance to be destroyed by monitoring
// Detail oriented- I want to have more insight into why my application is degrading
// Balanced- I want more detail as long as it's not impacting the perf of my application



// Levels: Info, Verbose

We are considering moving from low -> high, what about the other way around?
Start profiling with a lot of detail

Context:
- Time since app start
- Time since level last enabled
- Rate of events (disable level only)
- Relevant counters
- 

How often will these be evaluated? 
- Counter values are evaluated, enabling higher levels of detail
- Profilers are disabled when rate is too high or no interesting events are happening
- Need a control mechanism that says "after enabling/ disabling, do not disable/ enable for x period of time"
- Enable.When(<condition>).While(<condition>)For.AtLeast()/AtMost()
- .Default(level)
  .Use(level).When(x => x.).Until(x => x.EventsSec > 100)
  .Use(level).When(x => x.)
  .Use(Counters).When();
- What do conditions do?
	- Check rate/ sec of events (this can only be known while the thingo is active)
	- Check event counter values
- How often are they evaluated? 
What is the long-term impact of starting and stopping?



IDEAS:
- State change based on repetitive duration of time
- State change based on value of event counters (e.g. bytes jitted > x for y seconds)
- State change based on rate of events received (e.g. > 100/sec, then disable events for x seconds)
- Premade profiles (e.g. perf vs investigation)
- Need to track what collectors are enabled and at what level of verbosity
- Will need to completely redesign the construction of event listeners
- Evaluate every collection (perhaps this will be too long?)
- Counters have to have their refresh frequency specified up front (default to 1 sec?)

- Counters will be updated at a fixed frequency, we can use this to inform judgments
- We need to take samples of the queue length via histogram
- E.g. thread pool, enable detail after we see a queue build up of y
- Collectors should be ignorant of verbosity changes (managed externally)
- Collectors need to expose additional information (e.g. counter values to base judgments on)



## Collector improvements
Overall:
- Make full use of all events captured by current verbosity levels
- Upgrade to the latest version of events

### GC
- Track finalizer processing times
- Track mark events (GcMarkWithType) to track the types of roots that hold memory
- Track pinned object heap size (heapstats v3)
- Track allocations more effeciently (don't use Verbose keyword). Can we support this in V3 of .NET core?
- GCHeapSurvivalAndMovementKeyword to track reserved sizes of heaps and positions
- Look into GCGlobalHeapHistory_V3?
- Track compactions?

### Execeptions
- Track times spent throwing + time spent handling events
- Offer fallback to the count event counter
- No need to use Information by default- can track with Error Level

### JIT
- _ilBytesJittedCounter to track bytes spent
- Offer to track greater verbosity?

### RuntimeInformation?

### [EventSource()] in coreclr
Possible ideas:
- HttpClient (time queued, connection count, etc)
- Dependency injection
- DNS lookups

Ideas to reduce CPU consumpton:
- don't track JIT on startup
- don't track TP stats unless unhealthy (e.g. too many queued tasks)
- don't track contention stats unless lots of contention
- don't track exceptions unless count is 

For each source of info, offer options to:
- increase verbosity (more detailed log events, e.g. alloc by heap)
- upgrade from event counters -> event traces 
- downgrade from event traces -> counters
- disable collectors entirely
